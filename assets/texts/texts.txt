Hello!
A bitmap image file loaded into memory becomes a DIB data structure â€“ an important component of the Windows GDI API. The in-memory DIB data structure is almost the same as the BMP file format, but it does not contain the 14-byte bitmap file header and begins with the DIB header. For DIBs loaded in memory, the color table can also consist of 16-bit entries that constitute indexes to the currently realized palette[8] (an additional level of indirection), instead of explicit RGB color definitions.
